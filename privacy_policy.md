## Privacy Policy

ENIGMA Consortium, Inc. releases the BRCA Exchange app as an open-source app, with source code available at the following address: https://github.com/BRCAChallenge/BRCAMobile. The BRCA Exchange app is provided by ENIGMA Consortium, Inc. at no cost and is intended for use as-is.

This page is intended to inform you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information while using the app.

**Information Collection, Storage, and Use**

We do not collect personal information from users of the app except to provide access to the service. Specifically, this encompasses issuing HTTPS requests to brcaexchange.org for searching for and retrieving information from our public database. In the course of normal usage of the app, the IP address of your device is shared with brcaexchange.org. For quality control purposes, we log these accesses on the brcaexchange.org server; no personally identifying information aside from your IP address is stored with these logs, and we do not share these logs with any third-party services.

In order to support the app's "follow variants" feature, we store a list of variant identifiers that you have followed locally on your device. The list of variants is never transmitted from your device. The app will periodically query brcaexchange.org for a full list of updated variants, then locally perform an intersection between the updated variants and the ones you follow in order to generate local notifications.

**Links to Other Sites**

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites, with the exception of brcaexchange.org, are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
